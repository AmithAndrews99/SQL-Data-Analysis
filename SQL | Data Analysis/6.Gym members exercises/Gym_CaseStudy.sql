-- CASE STUDY: Gym Members' Exercise Tracking Analysis

-- Description:
-- The following dataset represents anonymized data collected from a fitness center to track the workout patterns and fitness progress of its members.
-- The dataset captures demographic details, physiological metrics, and workout-related attributes such as heart rate, session duration, calories burned,
-- workout type, and experience level.

-- Key Columns:
-- Age: Age of the gym member
-- Gender: Gender of the gym member
-- Weight (kg): Member's weight
-- Height (m): Member's height
-- Max_BPM: Maximum heart rate recorded during workouts
-- Avg_BPM: Average heart rate recorded during workouts
-- Resting_BPM: Resting heart rate
-- Session_Duration (hours): Duration of workout session
-- Calories_Burned: Calories burned per session
-- Workout_Type: Type of workout performed (Yoga, HIIT, Cardio, Strength, etc.)
-- Fat_Percentage: Body fat percentage
-- Water_Intake (liters): Daily water intake
-- Workout_Frequency (days/week): Number of days a member works out in a week
-- Experience_Level: Fitness experience on a scale of 1 (Beginner) to 5 (Expert)
-- BMI: Body Mass Index
